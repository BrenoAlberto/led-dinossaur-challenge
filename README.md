# Fastest Dinossaur Script
## Challenge description
The challenge will evalue the following items:

- Logic Programming;
- Data Manipulation;
- Activity Execution;
- Unit Testing;

You are receiving two files in CSV. The first file has stats about dinossaurs. The second has additional data.

Given the folling formula:

Velocity = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT (LEG_LENGTH * g) where
g = 9,8 m / s ^ 2 (gravitational constant)

â€¢ Write a program to read the files and print only the names of bipedal dinossaurs from the fastest to the slowest. Do not print any other information

You should send us the following file:
1. output.txt; The result of the exercise.
2. code.txt; The code used to generate the output.

Use languages and technologies that you have domain to present the best result!
